Triporate is a company that searches to simplify work-related traveling, providing a full service of ticket and accommodation purchase.
This project is a multiplatform solution for the viewing of plane, train and bus tickets, giving the user the possibility of having all of his boarding passes in one digital Wallet, without the need of downloading additional apps or files.
The main issue we looked after was to make available an Apple exclusive service to all the operating systems, fulfilling the purpose of Triporate to simplify travel arrangements for users of both Android and iPhone devices.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

Our solution is a React application with the following components:
• React
•	App
•	Tickets
•	Info
•	QRCode
•	Second Page
The styling was made with Sass and the project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
